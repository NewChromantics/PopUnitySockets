PopUnitySockets
===================
Very simple socket components (with matching API)
- Auto-reconnect via list of hostnames & ports (cycles through them all when connection fails)
- Just `OnBinaryPacket` and `OnTextPacket` (where applicable) events
- Some abstractions for different platforms (I swear I wrote a hololens/uwp one)

Installation
--------------------
- In unity's package manager, `+ Add from git url` and use `https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopUnitySockets.git`
or
- Add as a git submodule.
